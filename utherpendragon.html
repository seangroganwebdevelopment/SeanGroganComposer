            <h2>Uther Pendragon - Tone Poem</h2>
            <br>

            <h3>STORY</h3>
            <br>

            <p>Uther Pendragon, a legendary figure in British mythology, was the father of King Arthur. According to the
                tales, Uther was a noble and powerful king of Britain. He desired Lady Igraine, the wife of Duke
                Gorlois, and sought the help of the wizard Merlin to disguise himself as Gorlois. Uther's plan
                succeeded, and he slept with Igraine, resulting in the conception of Arthur.</p>
            <p>
                During his reign, Uther fought against invading Saxons, displaying his strength and leadership. However,
                his life was cut short by treachery and betrayal. Uther fell victim to a poisoned spear, leaving the
                kingdom in turmoil.</p>

            <p>
                Despite his tragic end, Uther's legacy lived on through his son, Arthur, who would become the legendary
                King Arthur of Camelot. Uther's story is one of power, love, and the prophesied rise of a great king who
                would unite Britain and wield the legendary sword, Excalibur.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>STORY OF COMPOSITION</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to delve further into the King Arthur world and universe after writing my first tone poem: King
                Arthur. I wanted to create a musical universe from all the characters in the stories, and perhaps even
                create my own characters to enhance and extend the original legend as passed down traditionally. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My ambitions went even further: I wanted to use this composition as a basis for stories, novels and even
                plays.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Uther Pendragon, as the father of King Arthur, was the first specific character I wanted to invesitage
                and
                represent. This seemed like a good starting point to approach the legend from.</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>

            <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
            <p>Uther, the father of King Arthur</p>
            <br>

            <h3>FORM</h3>

            <p>I broke the piece down into several sections, each of which represents a particular episode or painting
                of mood and character in Uther's story. </p>

                <p>ONE: desire for Lady Igraine (violent)</p>
                <p>TWO: discussion with Merlin (magical)</p>
                <p>THREE: Disguise as Gorlois and seduction (mysterious) </p>
                <p>FOUR: The conception of Arthur</p>
                <p>FIVE: The Death of Gorlois</p>
                <p>SIX: The Marriage to Igraine</p>
                <p>SEVEN: The Birth of Arthur</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>INSTRUMENTATION</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Uther - Bassoon. This seemed to me a fitting instrument, not to dominant like the brass, for a fine,
                subtle character, but one still possessing weighty authority.</p>

            <h3>MOTIFS</h3>
            I gave Uther a martial motif, played on the bassoon.
