            <h2>Uther Pendragon - Tone Poem</h2>
            <br>

            <h3>STORY</h3>
            <br>

            <h3>STORY OF COMPOSITION</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to delve further into the King Arthur world and universe after writing my first tone poem: King
                Arthur. I wanted to create a musical universe from all the characters in the stories, and perhaps even
                create my own characters to enhance and extend the original legend as passed down traditionally. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My ambitions went even further: I wanted to use this composition as a basis for stories, novels and even
                plays.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Uther Pendragon, as the father of King Arthur, was the first specific character I wanted to invesitage
                and
                represent. This seemed like a good starting point to approach the legend from.</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>

            <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
            <p>Uther, the father of King Arthur</p>
            <br>

            <h3>FORM</h3>
            
            <p>I broke the piece down into several sections, each of which represents a particular episode or painting of mood and character in Uther's story. </p>

           <br>


            <h3>INSTRUMENTATION</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Uther - Bassoon. This seemed to me a fitting instrument, not to dominant like the brass, for a fine, subtle character, but one still possessing weighty authority.</p>

            <h3>MOTIFS</h3>
            I gave Uther a martial motif, played on the bassoon.
