            <br>

            <h3>STORY</h3>
            <br>

           
            <br>

            <h3>CONCEPTION</h3>
            <br>

            <p>The piece is based primarily on mood. The first movement is slow and tragic, like something out of Panufnik. The scond movement is faster and anxious. The third slow, painful resignation. The fourth some kind of peace. Like with grieving. 1 - pain 2 - anger 3 - painful acceptance 4 - making peace </p>
            <br>



            <h3>STORY OF COMPOSITION</h3>
            <br>
            

            <img src="images/castles/caleb-fisher-tX7d6Qb_4HY-unsplash.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
           
            <br>
            <p></p>

            <br>

            <h3>FORM</h3>
            <br>

            <p>I broke the piece down into several sections, each of which represents a particular episode or painting
                of mood and character in Uther's story. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>INTRO</h4>
            <p>The intro sets the tone of menace and power and glory for the piece</p>
            <br>
            <p>The introduction presents the Uther motif and suggests the dreamy yet urgent quality that characterises his life.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>SECTION ONE</h4>
            <br>
            <h5>Desire for Lady Igraine</h5>
            <br>

            <p>Uther sees Igraine from a distance. The ominous sound and motif of the bassoon is present. The beauty of
                Igraine. Uther's violent desire. Uther hides and retires</p>
                <p>This section is in ternary form: A expresses Uther's power and unease, B the confusion of his feelings and A the transformation brought about by Lady Igraine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This section contains a theme in small ternary form. </p>
          
            <p>The ternary theme contains a plaintive melody in the bassoon in the a section, with minimal accompaniment
                in the exposition and string accompaniment in the recap. The B section is more chromatic and polyphonic
                to suggest the complications of Uther's life.</p>
            <br>

            <p><span>transition</span>: a long transition slows the tempo and changes the mood to prepare for the
                encounter with
                Merlin. This is a two part transition, with part1 deriving from section 1 and part II looking forward to
                section two</p>
            <br>

            <h4>SECTION TWO</h4>
            <p>discussion with Merlin (magical)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Uther goes to see Merlin to see what he can do. He is haunted by Igraine's beauty. He feels that he is
                transformed. The bassoon changes into different instruments. </p>
            <br>

            <p>THREE: Disguise as Gorlois and seduction (mysterious) </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Uther motive is taken on by another instrument and rhythm altered. </p>

            <p>FOUR: The conception of Arthur</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>

            <p>FIVE: The Death of Gorlois</p>
            <p>SIX: The Marriage to Igraine</p>
            <p>SEVEN: The Birth of Arthur</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>INSTRUMENTATION</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>SECTION ONE</h4>
            <p>Uther - Bassoon. This seemed to me a fitting instrument, not to dominant like the brass, for a fine,
                subtle character, but one still possessing weighty authority.</p>
            <p>Igraine: Flute</p>



            <h3>MOTIFS</h3>
            I gave Uther a martial motif, played on the bassoon.
